TODO for PeacemakerAI

try using commander to coordinate repairs
redo getLargestOilClusterID action
set factory rally point

order units to stop before reaching rally point

-retreating vtols should attack random derrick after a few secs
try setting retreating vtols to scout instead of rtb
handle group of roaming aa better with alphastrike

vtol call in support when attacking aa
derrick call in vtol support on spotted targets

-prune eventattacked -- support is not called in
-delay research until 3 vtol pads built
-print debugging to in-game console
swap pilots to strongest units -- undo scraping
-vtols should respond to attacks on derricks and units
-delay building second vtol factory
-repairs getting stuck at base after rtb defend

-new units should stop moving on build -- not move to rally point
-truck run zone should be smaller
-remove strongest player messages
-remove time from console logs
what to do with excess energy? defenses? repair? bank it? build factories?

alphastrike massed mobile aa
check to make sure all trucks are in groups
patrol idle base trucks

-leastaaplayer not working
-destroyed base oil not being rebuilt
===========================================

-don't return oilbuilder to upgrade factories
-delay upgrade of factories if vtol is available but not filled
-attack bandit walls instead of scout
-make pads sparse
clean up remaining units after buildings
move off burning ground
-build tech level 3 air defense
 vtols not defending
-idle vtol not attacking lassat
-vtol alpha strike not working
-build more power early if needed
-delay building defenses until 2 power

-AA bunker building not working
-damaged vtols not repairing
-command still being built before relay
random lab still favors lab
-build AA site not working

-no grabbing helpbuild basebuilders 
-require less pads at higher levels

if ultimate scavs at tech 0 fast build one aa unit

use derrickAttacks

-remove recycling droids from groups

-make trucks steal any oil
-trucks are not turning back when threatened and moving to build

-attackEnemy use closest target
-if dorder guard and daction none for attackers
better routine for defenders
-vtols should track down trucks

if many opponents build fortress near base
build and defend wall trucks

if truck is repairing do not retreat
-grab idle repair droids
add if droid can reach location to targeting
-add repair to supportgroup 1/5

=-=================================

-trucks do not capture oil unless its visible
-research gets upgraded too late
-trucks that did not build on oil should move to oil
============================

-demolish trees near base
demolish trees everywhere when not attacking
try to prevent basebuilders building in a difficult place to reach near base
if base builder gets too far from base turn back and try to build somewhere else
idle basebuilders should patrol


====

-build less defenses in base
-prefer indirect fire for base defenses

getClosestMapEdges()
build base toward map edge

-basebuilders should be more if there are many derricks

-attack most thretening player
-getStrongestPlayer()
