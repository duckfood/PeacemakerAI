PeacemakerAI_RC1 13/02/2026

PeacemakerAI is a skirmish AI bot for Warzone2100. You are free to do as you wish with the code, many snippits are from messageboards. If you make a derivative AI from it please credit duckfood on github.

To install git or unzip in the mods folder for your version of Warzone2100, then run the make bat or sh.

PeacemakerAI is based on the prototypical SemperFi from the base Warzone2100.

The goal is to write a non-cheating AI that uses databases to keep track of enemy forces instead of simply enumerating them. It still cheats some to compete with the AI in the base game. It knows where derricks and some buildings are unseen, but it does not respond to units that have not been spotted for the most part. Once an opponent AA unit has been spotted it is tracked without being seen again.

PeacemakerAI may still be vulnerable to an early truck rush, but once established it should put on a good show at any tech level and many opponents. Battle focus is repair, flame, HVC, and VTOL. PeacemakerAI was designed to defeat Nullbot, Cobra, Bonecrusher, and SemperFi unallied in the same skirmish.

Timers are used extensively to make units smart, so you will need a faster CPU for it run smoothly.
